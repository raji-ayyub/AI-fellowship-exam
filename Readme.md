    ```
2. Review by running the code, select options for the question to review

## My solutions

1. I have an entry loop to select which question to review
2. for question 1, calculator, i defined operation functions, set options to select operation, then use the created operation functions in a while loop where inputs are requred for the numbers needed for the operation and the operation is auto carried out.

3. question 2, i fixed proper function declaration syntax, as well as proper indentations and  loop, also using break to end loop. use int to convert to integer

4. question 3, I used ValueError: to except to check invalid value, then placed age in int() during try loop to convert input only during checking age limit.
